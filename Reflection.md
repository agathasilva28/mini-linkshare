## Did you use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? If so, how?
I used AI tools for basic settings files like `docker-compose.yml`, `config.json`, and `api/index.js`.

P.S. I also used it to fix my grammar in those texts, as English is not my first language.

## What did you build or decide manually?
I built and decided on all the main features and structures of the application manually.

## Where did you need to think critically or make decisions beyond AI suggestions?
I used AI to create the models but had to edit them to make sure its correct.

## What would you improve with more time?
- Include validation for inputs to create links and users.
- Add tests.
- Extract code from controllers, creating a services folder.
- Improve the visual design to make it look better.
